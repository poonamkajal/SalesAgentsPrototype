### 1. Company Strategy  
- **Multi‑Cloud, Multi‑Region Architecture** – Snowflake’s core promise is to run on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud without code changes, enabling customers to avoid vendor lock‑in.

- **Unified Data Lakehouse Platform** – Snowpark (SQL + Java/Scala/Python) and native support for semi‑structured data (JSON, Avro, Parquet) position Snowflake as a one‑stop shop for analytics, BI, and data science.  
- **Data Marketplace & Sharing** – Snowflake Data Marketplace and secure data sharing APIs accelerate data collaboration across partners and verticals.  
- **Enterprise‑Grade Security & Governance** – Zero‑Trust architecture, always‑on encryption, and fine‑grained access control cater to regulated industries (finance, pharma, government).
